# Car Price Prediction using Kaggle Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as car make, model, year, mileage, and more. Using a dataset from Kaggle, we applied several machine learning models to estimate car prices accurately. The project provided deeper insights into data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models for future predictions.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and plots.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new features from existing ones to enhance model performance.
3. **Normalization:** Standardized numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.

## Model Selection
Tried various regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting

Used Grid Search and Cross-Validation to tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model.

## Evaluation
Assessed models using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared

Visualized model performance through plots to understand prediction accuracy.

## Key Insights
- Feature importance analysis revealed that car age, mileage, and brand were significant predictors of car prices.
- Advanced models like Gradient Boosting provided better accuracy compared to simpler models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Data Imbalance:** Addressed the imbalance in car brands by using techniques like SMOTE.
- **Model Overfitting:** Implemented cross-validation and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- **Interpretability:** Focused on making the model interpretable to understand the factors affecting car prices.
